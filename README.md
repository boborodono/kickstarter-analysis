# Kickstarting with Excel
## Overview of Project
### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to use historical data from kickstarter to give Louise information that will maximize the chances of her play's success by attempting to answer...
-  When the optimal time of year to begin a theater campaign would be.
-  Estimate how much $ should her campaign goal be.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

I didn't have much difficulty putting together the charts and creating the analysis with the help of the generally clear instructions. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
I didn't have much difficulty putting together the charts and creating the analysis with the help of the generally clear instructions. I probably would have had difficulty organizing the data by month instead of year or quarter if the instructions had not helped me here. I think Louise would have been challenged to have any actionable insights if I didn't know how to organize the data by only the relevant information, ie. "Plays." If I had included all of the irrelevant categories and subcategories into the analysis, I don't think it would be as useful or accurate.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
1. To maximize Louise's chance of success funding her play she should run the campaign sometime between April and August. May would historically be the best month.
2. Louise should generally avoid running her campaign in the Winter/Holiday months as these times have the highest rate of failure and lowest chances of success.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
1. To maximize Louise's chance of funding her play she should keep her goal amount to less than $5000. 
2. Between $35,000 to $45,000 there is a 66% chance of success. However, I don't feel there is a large enough sample size to recommend this large of a goal target. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
1. The dataset is not current. The information is a few years old and if Louise wanted to gather data about post-pandemic campaigns this information may not be as useful. 
2. If the type of play (comedy/tragedy, etc.) was broken down maybe Louise could see which genres are most likely to succeed. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
1. Pie Graphs to show the % of successful versus failed campaigns. 
2. Line graph to see how the success of kickstarter play campigns has changed over the years.
